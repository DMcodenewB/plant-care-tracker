# Plant care planner
___

> [!NOTE]
> The project is in the early development stage

This is a simple contenerized database app, which is a plant growth tracker.

The app allows for plant management, task planning for every plant, and idk what else

Also, maybe an administration panel

To run the application, use `run_app.bat` in the terminal. 
Make sure to have a docker Daemon running.
